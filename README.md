# PostfixEvaluator

This PostfixEvaluator program implements stack and linked list data structure. Given a filename specified on the command line, it will:
. Repeatedly, as long as there is data in the file
. Read a string that represents a legal postfix expression (integers and operators only)
. Evaluate the expression
. Display the original string and the result
